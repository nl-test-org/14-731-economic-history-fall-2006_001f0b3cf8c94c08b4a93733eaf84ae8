Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

We will endeavor to teach you about three things in the course:

1.  _Economic History_, in particular, processes like industrialization and demographic change that took a long time, and policies that affected them.
2.  _Applied Economics_, emphasizing the great variety of approaches that have been used to formulate and test hypotheses.
3.  _Paper Writing_, by examining critically the economic-history literature and giving you an opportunity to practice writing a paper suitable for a professional journal (as some term papers, after revision, have been).

Course Requirements
-------------------

The assigned reading should be completed before the date noted on the syllabus. Class discussion will be more productive and enjoyable if you have done the reading. There will be a short final exam in the last scheduled class period and a term paper that is due at the end of the semester. Additional details about the paper can be found in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments) section.

The term paper is the most important part of the written requirement for this subject. Extensions will be given only for unanticipated events. Late papers will receive lowered grades on a gradient that makes passing this course problematical with a paper that is more than a few days late. Plan accordingly.
